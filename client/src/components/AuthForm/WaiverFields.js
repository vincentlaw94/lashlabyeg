        part of this procedure i understand that eyelash extensions are adhered to my own natural lashes. I understand that the natural lash
        cycle is sixty to ninety days. when one lash falls out, there is another lash growing in. I understand that I am required to follow the
        eyelash extension after care guide in order to maintain my eyelash extensions. I understand that variables, including the natural lash
        cycle and customer care, will influence the longevity of my eyelash extensions. I understand that it is my responsibility to keep my
        eyes closed and be still during the entire process, until my eyelash technician addresses me to open my eyes I understand the fumes
        from the adhesives may cause my eyes to tear up. I agree to disclose any allergies that I may have to latex, surgical tape,
        cyanoacrylate, Vaseline, etc.
