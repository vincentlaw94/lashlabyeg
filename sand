getting data from a server
processing how we get the data from the server.
it is an asynchronous process.
waiting for a response from big database query  can take up to 15 seconds.

if it was done synchronously the browser would have to wait until the action is done before doing anything else.

in an asynchronous call, the browser doesn't stop at the async call while you wait for the response. Once the response from the query is recieved, the execution jump to the callback which is suppose to exevute after that particular response is recived.

Queuing the database takes a while to do.
